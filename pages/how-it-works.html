                <h3>Carpool Vote connects <a href="#how-drivers">volunteer drivers</a> with <a href="#how-riders">anybody who needs a ride</a> to claim their vote.</h3>
                <h4>Anybody can sign up to get a ride or to drive somebody: We welcome humans of any race or ethnicity, age, sex or gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, family situation, or religious or political belief.</h4>

                <h2 id="how-riders">Riders</h2>
                <p>Need a ride to claim your vote? Some of our riders need to get to the polls - either on polling day or during early voting. Others need to travel to get a photo I.D.</p>
                <p>Whatever your situation, simply click the <a href="../#need-ride">I need a ride</a> button on the CarpoolVote.com home page and fill in your details.</p>

                <p>Our system will then match you with a driver, based on the information you've provided. This match will be based on when and where you need a ride, for how many people, and disability adjustments you may need.</p>
                <p>You'll receive another message as soon as you've been matched. The driver will receive a similar email, including your contact information.</p>
                <p>The driver will then contact you directly to arrange the details of the ride.</p>
