# Carpool Vote

Carpool Vote connects volunteer drivers with anybody who needs a ride to claim their vote. We are a nonpartisan organisation: Our goal is to increase voter turnout and improve representation.

We are racing to get this site up and running for the 2016 US Presidential election. We're a team of volunteers from around the world, working pro bono in our free time alongside our day jobs. As a result, we need all the help we can get, and any contributions would be gratefully appreciated.

## Slack

We have a [Slack team](https://carpool-vote.slack.com/)! Please [email us](mailto:slack@carpoolvote.com) if you would like to join.

## Technical

We have an API set up at https://github.com/voteamerica/backend. The current live version of the API can be accessed via https://api.carpoolvote.com/live/, while a test version is at https://api.carpoolvote.com/test/.
